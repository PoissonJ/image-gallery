# Angular 2 Image Gallery

## Steps to run
- `git clone https://github.com/PoissonJ/image-gallery.git`
- `cd javascript`
- `npm install`
- Launch the application using `npm start`
- Your default browser will be opened to `localhost:3000`

### Tests
This Angular 2 template is a modified version of https://github.com/antonybudianto/angular2-starter
which includes tests for the the included components. To run these tests, simply run `npm run test`.

For the image gallery part of the project, I included a simple e2e test. You can run just the e2e tests
by running `npm run e2e`. This test is located in `src/test/e2e/home/home.spec.ts`
